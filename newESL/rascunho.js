  When I get home, 
  I start on dinner right away. 
  I clean off the kitchen counter 
  after putting away the groceries 
  and decide to make pasta. 
  
  So, I preheat the oven to 375, 
  in other words, 375 degrees Fahrenheit. 
  I preheat it because I want to bake the bread 
  and keep the chicken hot until my wife gets home.|

  |So,I open the oven door, 
  I put in the bread, 
  I put in the chicken, 
  and then I close the door. 
  My wife is going to be home late 
  so I want to keep the chicken hot
  I want to make sure that it stays hot.| 

  |So, I put some water in a pan 
  and I turn the burner on high.
  I'm going to boil some water.|
  






  

  When the water starts boiling, 
  I put in the pasta and decide to make a salad. 
  Just then, my wife opens the back door and yells, “I’m home!” 
  She comes into the kitchen, 
  and helps with chopping the tomatoes to add to the sauce. 
  








  She stirs the sauce until it’s done, while I finish tossing the salad.
  I get out the place mats and napkins to set the table. 
  I also make sure that there is a spoon, knife, fork, and plate for each of us. 
  
  
  About 15 minutes later, we sit
  down at the table in the dining room and talk about our long day. My wife says
  she’ll do the dishes, since I cooked, but of course I help out by drying them.
  First, I put some of the leftovers in a Tupperware container and some in plastic
  wrap and the rest in aluminum foil. Then I dry the pans, plates, glasses, and
  silverware.
